# Important Concepts from Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository aims to distill key concepts related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and their mechanics, based on an expert's explanation.

## 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs are the **backbone** for advanced technologies like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). They are powerful models designed to understand and generate human-like text.

### 1.1 Variety of LLMs
There are thousands of LLMs available, including:
*   **Google's Gemini** and other Google models
*   **OpenAI's ChatGPT**
*   **XAI's Grok**
*   **Deep** from China
*   **Anthropic's Claude** models
*   **Meta's Llama** models (e.g., Llama 2, Llama 3)

### 1.2 Open Source vs. Closed Source LLMs
LLMs can be categorized by their accessibility:
*   **Open Source LLMs:** Models like Llama 2 or Llama 3 allow users to **download their core files** (parameter file and run file). This enables them to be **run locally on a personal computer**, offering **maximum data security** because no data goes over the internet. Users can also **fine-tune** these models themselves. Local use means **no payment for token generation**.
*   **Closed Source LLMs:** Models like ChatGPT or Gemini **cannot be downloaded or run locally**. Users must interact with them via a **web interface or an API** (Application Programming Interface). A major drawback is the **lack of local control and potentially less data security**. Users typically **pay for tokens** generated when using these models via an API.

### 1.3 LLM Core Structure: Two Files
An LLM is essentially comprised of two main files:
*   **Parameter File:** This is the "magic" file where the LLM's vast knowledge and patterns are stored. It is **gigantic** in size because it contains billions of "parameters" (e.g., Llama 2 DB model has 70 billion parameters). This file is created by **compressing massive amounts of text data** (e.g., 10 terabytes of internet text like Wikipedia articles) down into a much smaller size (e.g., 140 GB). It functions much like a **zip file**, storing compressed information. The compression process requires a **lot of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) power**.
*   **Run File:** This is a much smaller file, typically only a few hundred lines of code (e.g., 500 lines). It is usually written in programming languages like C or Python. Its sole purpose is to **run the parameter file**, allowing the LLM to function.

## 2. Tokens: The Building Blocks of LLM Communication
All LLMs process and generate information in units called **tokens**.

### 2.1 What are Tokens?
*   When you input a question or prompt, the LLM first converts your words into **numbers**, which are these tokens.
*   The LLM's **neural network** then performs calculations using these token numbers to predict the most likely next word in a sequence.
*   It's important to note that **not every single word is one token**; words can be divided differently, and punctuation can also be separate tokens.
*   Generally, about **four characters in English make up one token**, meaning roughly 1,500 words equate to about 2,048 tokens.

### 2.2 The Token Limit: LLM Memory
Every LLM has a **token limit**, which determines how much information it can "understand" or remember in a single conversation.
*   Once this limit is **reached**, the LLM will **forget earlier parts of the conversation**. It only "knows" the **last few tokens**.
*   Token limits **vary significantly** between models, from as low as 4,000 tokens for smaller open-source models to up to 2 million tokens for some advanced models. For example, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4 Omni have a limit of approximately 128,000 tokens (roughly 100,000 words).
*   Technologies like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG or DirectX technology) are being developed to **address and fix these token limitations**.

## 3. LLM Training Phases
The process of creating a base LLM involves three main training phases:

### 3.1 Pre-training
*   This is the initial phase where the LLM is trained on **massive amounts of text data** (e.g., 10 terabytes) collected from the internet.
*   During pre-training, the LLM **learns the structure of human language** and becomes capable of predicting the next most likely word in a sequence.
*   Initially, the model might "hallucinate" or generate incorrect information.
*   This phase requires a **lot of GPU power** to compress the vast text data into the parameter file.

### 3.2 Fine-tuning
*   After pre-training, the LLM undergoes fine-tuning, where it is given **many examples of how humans prefer their responses**.
*   This involves feeding the LLM pairs of questions and human-approved answers (e.g., "What should I eat today?" with "You could eat steak today").
*   By seeing roughly 100,000 such examples, the LLM **learns to generate responses that are aligned with human preferences**.
*   This phase is **much cheaper** and requires less GPU power than pre-training.

### 3.3 Reinforcement Learning
*   This is the final training step to further refine the LLM's responses.
*   Users interact with the LLM, asking questions and **rating the quality of the answers** (e.g., "thumbs up" if good, "thumbs down" if not).
*   This feedback helps the LLM **continuously improve** its ability to provide better and more desired responses.

## 4. Prompt Engineering
While not a technical component of the LLM itself, **prompt engineering** is a crucial concept for users. It refers to the art of **asking good questions** or crafting effective prompts, which directly leads to **getting good answers** from the LLM.
