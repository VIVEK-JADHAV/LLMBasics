### Expanding LLM Knowledge: Understanding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

#### 1. Introduction to Expanding LLM Knowledge

When aiming to provide a Large Language Model (LLM) with **additional knowledge**, there are generally two primary options: **in-context learning** or **direct technology**. While other methods like fine-tuning exist, direct technology, which involves embeddings and vector databases, is presented as one of the best and most efficient ways to achieve this.

#### 2. The Challenge: Context Window Limitations

A fundamental limitation of LLMs is their **context window**. The context window is where the LLM processes and understands the current conversation or prompt. Sooner or later, if you provide too much context or attempt to upload a large volume of documents (like "a gazillion PDFs"), the **token limit will be reached**. Once the context window is full, the LLM will no longer understand what you are discussing. This limitation makes it impractical to directly feed all desired knowledge into the prompt.

#### 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): The Solution

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, also referred to as "direct technology" in the sources, is a robust method to overcome the context window limitation and provide LLMs with dynamic access to vast amounts of external data. It allows the LLM to browse and search information from uploaded files, effectively giving it additional, up-to-date knowledge.

##### 3.1. Core Components: Embeddings and Vector Databases

The entire RAG process hinges on two crucial components: **embeddings models** and **vector databases**.

*   **Files and Documents**: The process begins with your raw data, which can be in various formats such as PDFs, CSVs, or other documents.
*   **Embeddings Models**: These models are responsible for transforming your raw data into a numerical format that LLMs can understand and process for semantic similarity.
*   **Vector Database**: This is where the processed numerical data (vectors/embeddings) is stored. A vector database is typically **three-dimensional** in concept and offers a large amount of space for storing these embeddings.

##### 3.2. How Embeddings Work

*   **Transformation to Vectors**: When you upload files, an **embeddings model** converts the content into **vectors**. These vectors are essentially lists of **numbers** (e.g., 0.2, 1.2).
*   **Semantic Meaning**: The purpose of these vectors is to make sense of the words and concepts. Words that are **semantically similar** will have numerically similar embeddings and thus be "close" to each other in the vector space. For instance, "apple" will have a similar embedding to "banana," while "wolf," "dog," and "cat" will form another cluster of similar embeddings.
*   **Clustering**: The embeddings model creates **clusters** of words or concepts based on their numerical proximity. For example, one cluster might contain all fruit-related terms, another animals, and another prices.
*   **Storage in Vector Database**: These clustered vectors are then stored in the vector database in a way that preserves their semantic relationships.

**Analogy of a Party/Club**:
To illustrate how the vector database works, consider a party or club.
*   Different **clusters** of people (embeddings) gather in different areas.
*   For example, there's a cluster of "drunk guys" at the bar, a cluster of "girls having fun" on the dance floor, and a cluster of "AI nerds" watching a course.
*   Just as a parent would know to search for their daughter on the dance floor (and not with the drunk guys or AI nerds), the LLM knows **exactly where to search** in the vector database for relevant information based on the query's semantic meaning. If you ask about "bananas," the LLM will search the "banana space" or "fruit embeddings" within the database.

##### 3.3. The RAG Process Flow

1.  **Document Ingestion**: You upload your documents (PDFs, CSVs, etc.).
2.  **Chunking and Embedding**: These documents are first **chunked** into smaller pieces, and then an **embeddings model** converts these chunks into vectors (embeddings).
3.  **Vector Database Storage**: The resulting vectors are stored in the **vector database**.
4.  **User Query**: A user asks a question or provides a query to the LLM.

##### 3.4. LLM Decision Making in RAG

When a user query comes into the LLM, the LLM makes a crucial decision:
*   **Known Answer**: If the LLM already **knows the answer** to the query (i.e., the answer is within its original training data and does not require external information), it will provide the answer directly without interacting with the vector database.
*   **Unknown Answer (Function Calling)**: If the LLM **does not know the answer** or determines that external information is needed, it will then perform a **function call** to search the vector database. This is a critical point where our previous discussion on **function calling** connects: the LLM leverages this capability to "talk to" the vector database.

##### 3.5. Retrieving and Presenting Information

1.  **Similarity Search**: When the LLM queries the vector database, it performs a **similarity search**. This means it looks for chunks or sentences in the database that are semantically most similar to the user's query.
2.  **Top-K Results**: The vector database returns the **most relevant documents or chunks**, which are known as **top-k results**. The `k` value determines the number of relevant chunks that are retrieved (e.g., `k=2` means two chunks, `k=8` means eight chunks).
3.  **Chunk Size**: Each returned chunk has a specific length, defined by the **chunking size**. For example, a chunk size of 500 means each chunk contains 500 tokens. Both the chunking size and the `top-k` value can be adjusted depending on the application.
4.  **Contextualized Answer**: These retrieved chunks are then fed back into the LLM. The LLM uses this newly retrieved context to structure a coherent and accurate answer to the user's query.

#### 4. Efficiency and Function Calling

RAG, or "direct technology," is highlighted as **much more efficient and faster** for providing additional knowledge to LLMs compared to fine-tuning. This efficiency stems from its ability to dynamically retrieve specific, relevant information without needing to retrain the entire model.

The LLM's interaction with the vector database, specifically when it needs to search for information, is facilitated by **function calling**. This means the LLM can "query or search the vector database if it's needed" through this mechanism. If the answer is already known and the vector database is not required, the LLM will not perform function calling for that particular query.
